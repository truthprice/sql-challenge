# Sql-Challenge

## Description

The purpose and motivation of this project was to create a database using employee data. Additionally, we wanted to ensure that proper relationships were created within the database and that information could be reliably queried from the database. By creating this database we have given ourselves the ability to extract information about our employees and departments within the company. This database also gives us the ability to perform calculations on data, if needed. 

## Results

The result is a database that includes six tables that hold information ranging from employee information (id numbers, names, date of birth, etc.) to departments and titles. 

## Usage

1. Create the appropriate tables using the provided schema.sql file.
2. Import the csv files for each table. Be sure to import the files in the same order in which the tables were created. 
3. Run the queries from the query.sql file. All required queries are seperated by a blank line of code and are commented out. Be sure to only uncomment the query you wish to run.
